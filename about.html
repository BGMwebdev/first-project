            <p>
                My name is Marleen, 29 years old, daughter, sister of 2 brothers, partner of my dear boyfriend, yoga
                teacher, studying in family constellations and human design and have a love for
                expression, sunlight and water. I decided very intuitively to drastically change my life, puzzle pieces
                are increasingly falling into place and the longing for wholeness pushes me
                forward in this life, lovingly and sometimes painfully. The bit that touches me now is reconnecting with
                women, old wounds, which can only be healed there, where it was
                once torn, in connection to other women. To stand strong as a woman, I have to look at the woman, in all
                her facets. That is my motivation for a women's circle, not as an example, but mainly to surrender to
                something bigger than me.

            <h2>My Mission</h2>
            <p>Everyone can shine in their individuality. I believe that anyone can live a life that is 'correct'. That
                there is a primal power in each of us, and if we learn to be authentic who we
                are, we as humanity will fit together with our environment like a puzzle piece. Within each of us lies a
                unique truth, which may be seen/discovered/questioned and unfolded in connection.
                Everything belongs, everyone belongs.</p>
