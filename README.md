# Women's Circle

### Introduction

Women should connect with other women, share their experience, and celebrate being women together! There is a lot of value in connection. To see others and be fully seen. A sense of acceptance, coming home, feeling safe, being able to truly relax and let go and even celebrate one another. 
This website provides awareness around the value of support and connection among women and make it accesible for them to reach out and even participate.
