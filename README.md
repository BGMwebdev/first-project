# Women's Circle

## Introduction

Women should connect with other women, share their experience, and celebrate being women together! There is a lot of value in connection. To see others and be fully seen. A sense of acceptance, coming home, feeling safe, being able to truly relax and let go and even celebrate who you are. 
This website will be targeted towards all women young and old from all walks of life, to provides awareness around the value of support and connection among women and make it accesible for them to reach out and even participate.

### Features
- Navigation bar
    - The fully responsive navbar is a feature that is presented on all pages. It contains the websites logo, and a navigation menu that is easily recognised.
    - The navigation bar is present on all pages to make navigating between pages easy, and there is no need for use of the back button in the browser window. 
    - The navigation menu contains a hover effect to make the user experience more pleasent. It will show an underline. 
    - The navigation bar also contains an 'active' function, which is shown by discoloration of the active page name in the menu. The user can see on which page they currently are.

- Landing page
    - The landing page has a background image to immediately draw in attention, and trigger curiosity. The image creates a sense of togetherness. With the gradient set as it is, it also creates something dreamy, something to long for. 
    - In the center there is an overlay of text with core principles of what a women's circle is about. The words are very relatable and speak to the needs of women.

### Design choices
- I picked purple as the primary color of the website. Purple is associaded with wisdom, spirituality, truth, inspiration, imagination and also royalty. I picked a contrasting color that would fit well and have a soft warm sense to it. For details I picked a light pink, which is often associated with femininity, self knowledge and creativity. As you will be able to read in the testing section, the contrast has been tested.

The chart was found on [Pinterest](https://nl.pinterest.com/pin/213709944790337176/)

### Features for the future
- A testimonial section, or user story section, where users can read about or even view (video content) the experience of other users. This will add to reliablility of information.
- A blog section where the user can read and relate to stories. This way a broader public can be reached.
