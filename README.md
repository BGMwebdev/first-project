# Women's Circle

## Introduction

Women should connect with other women, share their experience, and celebrate being women together! There is a lot of value in connection. To see others and be fully seen. A sense of acceptance, coming home, feeling safe, being able to truly relax and let go and even celebrate who you are. 
This fictive website will be targeted towards all women young and old from all walks of life, to provides awareness around the value of support and connection among women and make it accesible for them to reach out and even participate. This website is inspired by and losely based on my loving partner's life and interests.

### Features
- Navigation bar
    - The fully responsive navbar is a feature that is presented on all pages. It contains the websites logo, and a navigation menu that is easily recognised.
    - The navigation bar is present on all pages to make navigating between pages easy, and there is no need for use of the back button in the browser window. 
    - The navigation menu contains a hover effect to make the user experience more pleasent. It will show an underline. 
    - The navigation bar also contains an 'active' function, which is shown by discoloration of the active page name in the menu. The user can see on which page they currently are.

- Landing page
    - The landing page has a background image to immediately draw in attention, and trigger curiosity. The image creates a sense of togetherness. With the gradient set as it is, it also creates something dreamy, something to long for. 
    - In the center there is an overlay of text with core principles of what a women's circle is about. The words are very relatable and speak to the needs of women. 

![Image of landing page](assets/readme/hero-image.png)

- What and Why
    - Underneath the landing page image, the user is directly introduces to information around what a women's circle is and why they should join, or what the value could be for them. 
    - The placing makes it easy for the user to immediatly get their curiosity met with en explaination.

- Footer
    - The footer contains a copyright.
    - The footer also contains social media links. This will allow the user to get instant acces to who she is and connect through social media. Because it's fictive, the links are not directed towards her personal pages.

![Image of the mission statement](assets/readme/my-mission.png)

- Events
    - There are two different events the user can participate in, making it accesible to different needs and/or agenda's. 
    - The two event cards show all the information needed, which makes it very easy and clear. Some needed details for actual evenst may be left out due to the fact it's fictitious, like costs, what to bring, maybe even a program, etc.
    - The added images are there to set the tone, create a mood and invite.

### Design choices
- I picked purple as the primary color of the website. Purple is associaded with wisdom, spirituality, truth, inspiration, imagination and also royalty. Purple is also a color Marleen likes a lot. I picked a contrasting color that would fit well and have a soft warm sense to it. For details I picked a light pink, which is often associated with femininity, self knowledge and creativity. As you will be able to read in the testing section, the contrast has been tested. 
- I wanted to keep the page minimalistic and clear. Less is more. No distractions from unnacessary features.

- The chart was found on [Pinterest](https://nl.pinterest.com/pin/213709944790337176/)

### Features for the future
- A testimonial section, or user story section, where users can read about or even view (video content) the experience of other users. This will add to reliablility of information.
- A blog section where the user can read and relate to stories. This way a broader public can be reached. 
- a google maps for directions / location to the venue.

- Bugs & errors
    - Image on about page wasn't rendering. I was advices on slack to change file path to relative path. This fixed the problem.
    - My events page was to slow, due to sizes of images. I put them through [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) to compress them. After that I made the physical size smaller with Paint 3D. This solved the issue. 
    - I couldn't get my footer at the bottom in the contact page. I tried display absolute / bottom 0, but this created an issue on mobile. The footer was seen on the keyboard. Eventually I used margin on my contact form to keep the footer down at the bottom.

### Deployment

- I've deployed the website early on, so I could test and update the website constantly.
- The steps taken to deploy the website are taken from a hackathon project I co-created [Smitten](https://github.com/alissatroiano/8-your-heart-out#deployment).

1. In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
2. Scroll down to Github pages
2. From the source section drop-down menu, select the main branch
3. Once the main branch has been selected, click "Save"
4. GitHub will display a message confirming that the site has been deployed successfully
5. GitHub will provide a link to the deployed site
6. Click on the link to view the site has deployed in a new tab

- The live link the deployed project can be found here: [Women's-circle](https://bgmwebdev.github.io/first-project/)
