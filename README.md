# Women's Circle

### Introduction {#introduction} 

Women should connect with other women, share their experience, and celebrate being women together! There is a lot of value in connection. To see others and be fully seen. A sense of acceptance, coming home, feeling safe, being able to truly relax and let go and even celebrate who you are. 
This website will be targeted towards all women young and old from all walks of life, to provides awareness around the value of support and connection among women and make it accesible for them to reach out and even participate.

- Landing page
    - The landing page has a background image to immediately draw in attention, and trigger curiosity. The image creates a sense of togetherness. With the gradient set as it is, it also creates something dreamy, something to long for.
