            <h2>What is a Women's Circle?</h2>
            <p>Women's circles are gatherings of women for women. Sometimes referred to as red tents, or moon lodges,
                the circles are spaces open to all ages, in which women gather during a new
                moon or full moon. Due to alleged similarities between lunar cycles and female cycles, historically the
                moon has been seen as harnessing a lot of power for women. It's why
                traditionally a full moon was seen as prime time for women to gather and grow awareness of their cycles.
                To this day, circles are a “supportive environment” in which women can be
                heard, held and seen. A circle is a space for self-reflection and rest, free of judgement. Gatherings
                are typically opened by one individual who encourages the
                group to connect as a sisterhood, and to share their wisdom and experiences. In addition to communing
                over food and (non-alcoholic) drinks, there are often calming rituals, like the
                burning of cleansing herbs, meditation, intention-setting, or sitting with an altar of meaningful
                objects. Also music and singing are common.

            <h2>Why should you join?</h2>
            <p>Women's circles are an opportunity to meet with others from all walks of life and share the wisdom of
                experience. Rather than carrying on as normal during their menstrual cycle or
                attempting to ignore it altogether women are encouraged to rest and honour a time of natural change in
                the body. This is not to say women's circles are only organized during
                menstrual cycles. The circle is a time to sink into the profound relaxation that comes from being
                understood for ourselves, exactly as we are, without masks, without judgement.
                Women's circles help to provide a safe space for women to share their true selves, where they can find
                their voice, reclaim their power, and remember their self-worth. Together you
                can celebrate your unique diversity, while honoring the universal divine feminine energy to foster
                self-growth and planetary transformation.
