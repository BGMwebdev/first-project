            <h2>What is a Women's Circle?</h2>
            <p>In a women's circle we heal what seems to have partially been lost, the connecting force between us as
                women. A place where we can share. Being able to fulfill needs, but above all,
                supporting each other in regaining our strength. The force that has been suppressed with the patriarchal
                system. The power of connection, collaboration and bringing each other to
                the light. Our desires, needs, lack, pain, traumas, shadows, etc. Everything has a place in the
                contained space of a women's circle. Everything is included.
        </div>
        <div id="circle-content-why">
            <h2>Why should you join?</h2>
            <p>Perhaps, like me, at some point in life you have lost faith in other women. A mother wound, sister wound
                or simply ended up in a man's world where you had to get your own place by
                means of elbow work. In every perpetrator there is a victim, and in every victim there is a perpetrator.
                To stop the violence, we start with ourselves. And we don't have to do that
                alone. You can handle the challenges in your life, and in doing so you deserve support, friendship and a
                lot of compassion. That's what we women can give each other.
