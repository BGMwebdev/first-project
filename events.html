            <h2>Getting Together</h2>
            <img src="assets/images/priscilla-du-preez-klein.jpg" alt="picture of women standing together laughing">
            <p>Transform ordinary surface conversations into juicy, heart opening, enlightening explorations for
                personal insights and healing. Become more present and comfortable in your own skin. Practice listening
                to the essence of someone's soul.
                The women's circle nights are an ongoing weekly event. As I have been doing this for a while, the group
                has become a tightly-knit and deeply welcoming community.
                This evening is for women of all ages. It offers a taste of the magic of a women's circle for people who
                are new to the practice, and it offers an opportunity for old-time Circlers
                to take a dive into the relational pool every week. It is often profound, surprising and fun! Come and
                join me on this weekly journey! </p>

            <img src="assets/images/clay-banks-klein.jpg" alt="picture of a woman celebrating">
            <p>Create aliveness and connection in every interaction and relationship in your life — from loved ones,
                colleagues, clients, to even strangers on the street.
                Show up as a powerful leader, create a bigger impact in the world, and expand your capacity to touch,
                move, inspire, and awaken others.
                Experience the vitality that comes from being REAL with others instead of letting fear direct your life.
                Expand your capacity to attract real love and create a relationship that thrives — emotionally,
                intellectually, sexually, and spiritually.
                Drop self-sabotaging behaviors and access your authentic power.
                Step over your own edge to see who and what is waiting for you on the other side and join me for deep
                dive into a women's circle connection!</p>
